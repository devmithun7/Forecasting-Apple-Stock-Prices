# Forecasting Apple Stock Prices

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting Apple's NASDAQ stock prices using time series analysis techniques. Specifically, we employed ARIMA and Facebook’s Prophet models to predict opening and closing stock prices, as well as trading volumes, based on historical data from 2018-2019. The performance of these models was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to ensure precision in forecasting future stock values.
